How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
    I interpet user needs by asking hem for feedback based on old products and if there is none, I ask for specific requests that they might have. Creating user stories helps because it clearly defines what the user wants and gives them a way to be apart of the creation of the product. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    The way I approach developing programs is by setting a goal for every week and by writing down either in a notebook or on a notepad the steps and goals that I should achieve for each week. I take an agile approach most of the time. I hope to incorporate is the scrum process. I have used it at my old school with a group of friends for our final project and I really liked the idea of having a scrum meeting everyday to see how the project is coming along and where everyone stands with it.
    
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    To be a good team member in software development means to understand the project and understand that the product that is being created is a team based product so they need to work together. A good team member should also follow all the basic requirements that the scrum master sets and always respect the other team members.
